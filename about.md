Welcome to my blog, where I keep record of things I do.

I'm interested in a little bit of everything computer related: algorithms, simulations, operating systems, numbers... but most of all I like reverse-engineering.

Other than that, I have a pet dragon which answers (mostly) to the name Hilda:

![Dragon](/assets/about/dragon.jpg){: .center-image }

If you spot any inaccuracy in one of my posts, feel like I wasn't clear enough, request anything or just give me a shout, email me at `danzat at gmail dot com`.
